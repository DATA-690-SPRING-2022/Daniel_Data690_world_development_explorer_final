Human civilization is defined by decisions that produce beneficial and harmful outcomes. One of the most major impacts for humanity that falls into both categories is industrialization. Industrialization has made processes such as manufacturing and transportation much easier than before, but that does not come without a cost. The modified processes produced during the industrial revolution are often fueled by non-renewable resources such as coal, oil, and natural gas, also known as fossil fuels. The aftereffects have caused changes to air quality, water purity, and the ozone layer due to increases in the emission of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).

The effect of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions also showed a direct impact on quality of life, whether this be through breathing in polluted air, prolonged exposure to carcinogens, and access to drinkable water sources. The direct results of these environmental changes can be measured in a variety of statistics, but two that have clear implications on human life are mortality rates from diseases and life expectancies. There are two major questions we can ask about these relationships:
  1. How do CO<sub>2</sub> emissions relate to both mortality rates from disease and life expectancy at birth? 
  2. How does renewable energy usage relate to both mortality rates from disease and life expectancy at birth? 

These can be answered by analyzing the correlation betweren CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and renewable energy usage worldwide in the years 2000 and 2015 to disease mortalities and life expectancy at birth.

## **1. Analysis Strategy and Approach**

- **Data Source:** World Development Explorer ([worlddev.xyz](https://))
- **Countries Analyzed:** Comoros, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Iceland, Moldova, North Korea (referred to here as Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Sweden, Uruguay, and Zimbabwe
- **Timespan of Data:** 2000-2015
- **Topics & Indicators:**
  - **Environment- Renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption):** the share of renewable energy in the total final energy consumption.
  - **Environment- CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (kt):** emissions of carbon dioxide stemming from the burning of fossil fuels and the manufacture of cement. These can include CO<sub>2</sub> produced during consumption of solid, liquid, and gas fuels and gas flaring.
  - **Health- Cause of death, by non-communicable diseases (% of total):** Cause of death is the share of all deaths at all ages due to underlying causes. Non-communicable diseases include cancer, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, digestive diseases, skin diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, and congenital anomalies.
  - **Health- Cause of death, by communicable diseases and maternal, prenatal and nutrition conditions (% of total):** Cause of death is the share of all deaths at all ages due to underlying causes. Communicable diseases and maternal, prenatal, and nutrition conditions include infectious and parasitis diseases, respiratory infections, and nutritional deficiencies such as underweight and stunting.
  - **Health- Life expectancy at birth, total (years):** The number of years a newborn infant would live if prevailing mortality patterns at time of birth remain the same throughout life.
